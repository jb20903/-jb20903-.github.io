<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;">The Lacrosse Life </h1> <p> Lacrosse is an up and coming sport that youth across the world are being introduced to.
Lacrosse is thought to have originated with various tribes of <strong STYLE="border-bottom-style: groove"> Native Americans </strong>. Over the years, the sport
and the equipment have evolved as different immigrants have come to America and molded the sport
into what it is today. When I was in high school, I played lacrosse and had a lacrosse coach that had
played the sport professionally before he began coaching. Women’s lacrosse varies greatly from men’s
lacrosse. My coach always used to joke that they attempted to water down the game of lacrosse for
women to play, but the women playing just became more intellectual on how they approached the play
of the game. Men’s lacrosse is aimed to be a more physical game where the players where shoulder
pads and helmets and are permitted to hit players of the opposite team with their stick. Women’s
lacrosse is designed to be played more strategically as the players only wear goggles and a mouth-piece
and are not allowed to explicitly hit their opponents. The sticks are also structured differently from the
men’s lacrosse sticks as the men’s lacrosse sticks are built with a pocket and require less cradling and
women’s sticks are the opposite. </p> <p> Lacrosse is similar to a few other sports played in America such as football and soccer. The
lacrosse field can also be utilized as a soccer field and a football field. On the field there are 11 players in
addition to the goalie. The positions of lacrosse players are attack, defense, midfield, and goalie. Attack 
is responsible for scoring points in the game, they have strong stick skills and are able to pass and throw
the ball effectively and efficiently. Defense is responsible for protecting the goalie as much as possible
and defending the goal from attackers trying to score. Midfielders play the role of both attack and
defense and are required to run the entire field and be able to move the ball effectively from one end of
the field to the other. The goalie like in other sports is responsible for keeping the goal and preventing
other people from scoring; in addition to this the goalie is responsible for clearing the ball back down
the field after they make a save. Unlike many other sports, the goalie in lacrosse is able to leave the goal
and be a participant in the game; doing this however puts a greater risk on the goalie that the other
team may score while they are not occupying the goal. </p> <p> A sport that has been around longer than a lot of others, yet still has not gained the popularity
and following of many newer sports. Lacrosse was up and coming when I was playing in high school
especially in my area. Generally, lacrosse is much more popular at high schools and colleges in more
northern states and those near larger major cities. As the sport begins to grow its teams, the fanbase
grows along with it. To learn more about lacrosse across the country, visit <a href="https://www.uslacrosse.org/"> The US Lacrosse Website. </a> </p>
